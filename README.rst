Seed7-mode - Emacs support for the Seed7 Programming Language
=============================================================


This is a **work-in-progress** version of seed7-mode ðŸš§ .
A lot of features are implemented but there's still some
areas that need improvements or fixes.
Please create a bug report for  any problem you detect.

Currently Implemented Features
==============================

- Syntax highlighting with user-customizable faces.
- Supports `Emacs outline minor mode`_: collapse and expansion of blocks,
  where heading is the first line of a declaration block. This allows
  navigation and code manipulation by headings (blocks).
- Provides a Seed7 top level menu entry.
- Support `Emacs imenu mode`_ and `Emacs Speedbar`_ for:

  - Seed7 procedures,
  - Seed7 functions,
  - Seed7 interfaces,
  - Seed7 structures,
  - Seed7 enums.

See the following example screenshots:

=========================== ================================================
Screenshot                  Description
=========================== ================================================
`Terminal-mode Emacs`_      Shows the default highlighting of Seed7 code on
                            Emacs running in a macOS Terminal.

`Graphical Emacs`_          Shows the default highlighting of Seed7 code on
                            a basic GUI Emacs running in a macOS with the
                            default scheme.

`Terminal Emacs Speedbar`_  Using Emacs Speedbar to navigate the Seed7/pgm
                            directory, listing function, procedures,
                            structures, etc...

`GUI Emacs Speedbar`_       Using macOS GUI Emacs with Speedbar in a separate
                            GUI frame showing beside the local instance of
                            the `PEL Speedbar PDF`_.

`GUI Emacs menu`_           Using macOS GUI Emacs with iMenu to list the
                            functions is the Seed7 file.  Unlike Windows
                            and most Linux desktops,
                            the Emacs menu shows up inside the macOS
                            top screen menu.

`Terminal menu 1`_          Using the top menu to access Seed7 code browsing
                            inside a terminal Emacs.

`Terminal menu 2`_          The selecting the Seed7 item as a second step
                            in the menu using a terminal Emacs.

`Terminal Ivy prompt`_      Instead of using the menu, using a prompt
                            with completion driven by ivy to search and select
                            Seed7 element.
                            Shown inside a terminal Emacs.
=========================== ================================================


Indentation Control / Automatic Indentation
-------------------------------------------

Code indentation is done automatically when the ``<tab>`` key is pressed
from anywhere on the line, except when used to expand a callable parameter in most cases.
Automatic code indentation is also done when the ``<return>`` key is pressed.

The ``auto-fill`` mode is supported.

The following customizable user-option variables control Seed7 code indentation.

= ======================= =================================================
. Variable                Purpose
= ======================= =================================================
. **seed7-auto-indent**   Control whether auto-indentation of Seed7 code is active.

                          - It is on by default.
                          - To disable auto-indentation, set ``seed7-auto-indent`` to nil,
                            then disable (by activating ``fundamental-mode``)
                            and re-enable ``seed7-mode``.

. **seed7-indent-width**  Number of columns used for each indentation level of Seed7 code.
                          Defaults to 2.

. **indent-tabs-mode**    Control whether Emacs inserts ASCII hard TAB characters
                          when indenting.  If set to nil Emacs will only use
                          ASCII SPACE characters.  If active (set to T or any non-nil
                          value) Emacs will insert ASCII hard TAB character to fill
                          indentation according to the number of columns of
                          indentation required and the number of columns
                          used to render a hard tab (as specified by **tab-width**).

                          For Seed7 code, the convention is to avoid hard TAB
                          characters in the code, therefore the **indent-tab-mode**
                          should be turned off to prevent seed7-mode auto-indentation
                          to insert hard TAB characters.

                          Use the **untabify** command to replace all hard TAB characters
                          in the buffer by the equivalent number of SPACE characters.

. **tab-width**           Controls the the column width of a hard TAB on display.
= ======================= =================================================


Notes:

- One aspect of the auto indentation logic is that it checks (and extracts)
  the name of procedure and functions and the return type of the function.
  The auto-indentation will only work properly once these are identified.
  This acts as a reminder to fill in the missing parts.
- ðŸš§ As this code is still under early development please report any problem you
  may encounter.


Code Template Insertion
-----------------------

Seed7 code templates are inserted at point when the ``<tab>`` key is pressed
after one of the supported code identifier keywords under specific
constraints:

- When point is following one of the keywords from the first group and that is
  the only word on the current line, or
- when point is following one of the keywords of the second group and is
  located just before a ``)`` character (with or without a space between point
  and the closing parenthesis.   The second group holds keywords for argument
  declarations.

After successfully expanding the Seed7 code template, point is located at the
first location that must be filled.  This location, and the following
locations that must be filled, are internally identified
by `Emacs tempo markers`_. You can use the ``tempo-forward-mark`` and
``tempo-backward-mark`` to move point to these markers.  The ``seed7-mode``
keyboard map binds the ``<backtab>`` key to  the ``tempo-forward-mark``
command.  So after expanding a code template, fill the first field and then
press ``<backtab>`` to move point to the next field.

As mentioned above there are two groups of keywords, listed in the following
tables.

**First Group -- Statements:**

Expand the following keywords when point is located just after any of these
keywords, with the keyword being the only word on the current line.

============ =========================================================

**funcs**    `short function declaration`_
.

.
**case**     `case statement`_
**if**       `if statement`_
**ife**      `if statement`_ with an else clause
**ifei**     `if statement`_ with an elsif clause
**ifeie**    `if statement`_ with an elsif and an else clause
**repeat**   `repeat - until statement`_

Code Navigation Commands
------------------------

Some of the commands have a built-in key binding in the seed7-key-map but not
all of them.  The `PEL Seed7 support`_ provides more key bindings using function keys.

= ============================ =========== =============================================================

Compatibility
=============

The seed7-mode is compatible with:

- Emacs `comment-dwim`_ command.  The recommended key binding for it is ``M-;``
- Emacs `which-function-mode`_, when active shows the name of the current Seed7 function or procedure in the
  mode line. It also works with Seed7 actions and forward declarations.
- The `iedit`_ package that allows selecting variables inside a specific block, function or procedure.
- The `expand-region`_ package to quickly select the current word, block, function/procedure.
- Drew Adam's `hide-comnt`_  package which  provides
  the `hide/show-comments-toggle` command to hide or show all comments.

More commands will be implemented.

How To Install seed7-mode with plain vanilla Emacs
==================================================


Preliminary notes to new Emacs users
------------------------------------

:Reference: `The Emacs Initialization File`_

Emacs can and will use a user initialization file, `init.el` if it finds one.

- Emacs looks for the init.el file inside the directory identified by
  the `user-emacs-directory` variable, one of many variable controls Emacs behaviour.

  - Emacs looks for the following files, in the following order by default:

    - ``~/.emacs``
    - ``~/.emacs.el``
    - ``~/.emacs.d/init.el``
    - ``~.config/emacs/init.el``

- Once started the name of the Emacs init file is stored inside the value of the
  **user-init-file** variable.
- It also stores the name of the Emacs directory inside the **user-emacs-directory**
  variable.

Inside Emacs you can see the current value of the above variables by typing the ``C-h o``
followed by the name of the variable.  For example:

- Type ``C-h o user-emacs-directory RET``; that will open a buffer
  describing the purpose of this  variable and
  show it's current value.  It also has a link to the Emacs Lisp
  code that defines it (which is part of Emacs and you should not modify).
- Type ``C-h o user-init-file`` to show the value of this variable.

The `user-emacs-directory` identifies the directory where Emacs
looks for the init.el file.  In Unix-like OS installations it is often
set to `"~/.emacs.d/"`.  Under Windows it will be located somewhere else.

**Changing from ~/.emacs to ~/.emacs.d/init.el**

If you have used Emacs default you may be using the ``~/.emacs`` file for your
Emacs init file.

- Using a complete directory to hold your Emacs initialization
  file *and* other Emacs related files, like the downloaded packages, your
  spelling dictionaries, your persistent customization, etc...

- To get Emacs use the ``~/.emacs.d/init.el`` file instead:

  - Create the ``~/.emacs.d`` directory,
  - Move your ``~/.emacs`` or ``~/.emacs.el`` file to ``~/.emacs.d/init.el``.
  - When you restart Emacs, check the value of **user-emacs-directory** and
    **user-init-file**; they should reflect the new location.


Install seed7-mode for plain-vanilla Emacs
------------------------------------------

Make sure your Emacs initialization file is stored inside the ``~/.emacs.d``
directory and is ``~/.emacs.d/init.el``.  If this is not the case read the
previous section.  Once this is done proceed with the following:

- **1: Create the utils sub-directory** to store stand-alone utilities Emacs lisp files
  like seed7-mode.el.
  That directory should be located inside the directory
  identified by Emacs `user-emacs-directory`:

  - Under Unix-like OS, for example, you would normally create the `~/.emacs.d/utils` directory.

- **2: Create the init.el file if it does not exists**:

  - Emacs `user-emacs-directory` identifies the directory where the init.el
    file should be located.

    - Under Unix-like OS, the file is normally `~/.emacs.d/init.el`

  - Create the file if it does not already exist.

- **3: Update init.el: write code to find files in utils and auto-load seed7-mode**

  - Inside your init.el file, write the following code:

  .. code:: elisp

            ;;; -*-lexical-binding: t; -*-

            (push (expand-file-name "utils" user-emacs-directory) load-path)
            (autoload 'seed7-mode "seed7-mode" nil :interactive)
            (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.s\\(d7\\|7i\\)\\'" . seed7-mode))

  - The first line activates lexical-binding.
    It **must** be the very first line of the file.
  - The other lines can be anywhere, but must be executed (in case you have
    some conditional logic).

- **4: Download seed7_mode.el file and copy it in the utils directory**

  - The utils directory is the one you created above.

- **5: Byte compile seed7-mode.el**

  - Open Emacs and edit (visit) the `seed7-mode.el` file located in your utils directory.
  - Byte compile it by typing the following command: `M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load`

  Byte compiling is not absolutely necessary but it will verify that
  everything is ok inside the file and will also speed up Emacs startup.
  Just remember to byte-compile that file every time you modify it,
  otherwise Emacs will complain that it's using a byte-compile file
  that is older than the source file.


How To update seed7-mode in plain Emacs
=======================================

To update to a later revision,

- Erase the seed7-mode.el and
  seed7-mode.elc files from the utils directory where you stored them.
- Download the new revision in the same directory.
- Byte-compile the new file as described in the previous section.


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to install and use seed7-mode with PEL
==========================================

You can also use my `PEL Emacs project`_ which deals with all installation and
control details of several packages including this seed7-mode.


- First `install PEL as described in the PEL manual`_
- To activate the installation and activation of the seed7-mode package you
  must set the PEL user-option for Seed7: **pel-use-seed7** to the value ``t``
  (which is one of the possible *true* values in Emacs Lisp).

  - Once PEL is installed, use the ``C-h o pel-use-seed7 RET``  key
    sequence to open the customization buffer to set this user option.  Then close
    Emacs and restart it. PEL will download and install the file in your
    ``~/.emacs.d/utils`` directory.
  - Open a Seed7 file, PEL provides extra command key bindings for Seed7 under
    the ``F12`` key prefix.

    - See the `PEL Seed7 PDF`_ for more information about PEL Seed7 Support.
    - The `PEL Index PDF`_ has links to several other PDF files on various
      Emacs-specific topics.

How to Update Seed7-Mode with PEL
=================================

With PEL, updating is a little simpler:
just delete your ``~/.emacs.d/utils/seed7-mode.*`` files and restart Emacs;
it will download the new version and byte-compile it.


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future
======


Once this code is stable I will add the logic to make it a proper Emacs
package and probably will include it under MELPA.  But the code is far from
being ready for that.

Any help, questions, suggestions are welcome!
