=============================================================
Seed7-mode - Emacs support for the Seed7 Programming Language
=============================================================


‚ö†Ô∏è  Early, **work-in-progress** version of seed7-mode  üöß .

Currently Implemented Features
==============================

- Syntax highlighting with user-customizable faces.
- Supports `Emacs outline minor mode`_: collapse and expansion of blocks,
  where heading is the first line of a declaration block. This allows
  navigation and code manipulation by headings (blocks).
- Provides a Seed7 top level menu entry.
- Support `Emacs imenu mode`_ and `Emacs Speedbar`_ for:

  - Seed7 procedures,
  - Seed7 functions,
  - Seed7 interfaces,
  - Seed7 structures,
  - Seed7 enums.

- Automatic indentation.
  The indentation is done automatically when the TAB key is pressed
  (from anywhere on the line). It's also done when the RETURN key is pressed.
  It support the ``auto-fill`` mode.

  - To disable auto-indentation, set ``seed7-auto-indent`` to nil, then
    disable and re-enable ``seed7-mode``.
    You can also disable it permanently by customizing it.
  - The auto-indent logic expects blocks to be complete, as it checks
    them for completion and nesting. That mechanism may change in the future,
    providing a less strict support.  However, during development, it allows
    me to detect more errors.
  - One aspect of the auto indentation logic is that it checks (and extracts)
    the name of procedure and functions and the return type of the function.
    The auto-indentation will only work properly once these are identified.
    This acts as a reminder to fill in the missing parts.
  - As this code is still under development please report any problem you
    may encounter.

- Automatic completion of the following statement when typing the ``<TAB>``
  key after the following keywords appearing at the beginning of a line
  inside Seed7 code:

  - **case**, **if**, **repeat**, **while**,
  - The 9 variations of for loops:

    - **for** expands to the `for statement`_,
    - **foru** expands to the `for-until statement`_,
    - **fors** expands to the `for-step statement`_,
    - **fore** expands to the `for-each statement`_,
    - **foreu** expands to the `for-each statement`_ combined with an until condition,
    - **forek** expands to the `for-each-key statement`_,
    - **foreku** expands to the `for-each-key statement`_ combined with an until condition,
    - **fork** expands to the `for-key statement`_,
    - **forku** expands to the `for-key statement`_ combined with an until condition,

  - **proc** and **func** expand to the boiler plate code for procedure and
    function.
  - **funcs** expands to the boiler plate code for short function.
  - **inc** expands to a partly filled include statement.
  - **enum** expands to a enum declaration.
  - **struct** expands to a structure declaration statement.
  - **var** expands to a variable declaration.

Code Navigation Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the commands have a built-in key binding in the seed7-key-map but not
all of them.  The `PEL Seed7 support`_ provides more key bindings using function keys.

= ============================ =========== =============================================================

Compatibility
=============

The seed7-mode is compatible with:

- Emacs comment-dwim.  The recommended key binding for it is ``M-;``
- The `iedit`_ package that allows selecting variables inside a specific block, function or procedure.
- The `expand-region`_ package to quickly select the current word, block, function/procedure.
- Drew Adam's `hide-comnt`_  package which  provides
  the `hide/show-comments-toggle` command to hide or show all comments.

More commands will be implemented.

How To Install seed7-mode with plain vanilla Emacs
==================================================


Preliminary notes to new Emacs users
------------------------------------

:Reference: `The Emacs Initialization File`_

Emacs can and will use a user initialization file, `init.el` if it finds one.

- Emacs looks for the init.el file inside the directory identified by
  the `user-emacs-directory` variable, one of many variable controls Emacs behaviour.

  - Emacs looks for the following files, in the following order by default:

    - ``~/.emacs``
    - ``~/.emacs.el``
    - ``~/.emacs.d/init.el``
    - ``~.config/emacs/init.el``

- Once started the name of the Emacs init file is stored inside the value of the
  **user-init-file** variable.
- It also stores the name of the Emacs directory inside the **user-emacs-directory**
  variable.

Inside Emacs you can see the current value of the above variables by typing the ``C-h o``
followed by the name of the variable.  For example:

- Type ``C-h o user-emacs-directory RET``; that will open a buffer
  describing the purpose of this  variable and
  show it's current value.  It also has a link to the Emacs Lisp
  code that defines it (which is part of Emacs and you should not modify).
- Type ``C-h o user-init-file`` to show the value of this variable.

The `user-emacs-directory` identifies the directory where Emacs
looks for the init.el file.  In Unix-like OS installations it is often
set to `"~/.emacs.d/"`.  Under Windows it will be located somewhere else.

**Changing from ~/.emacs to ~/.emacs.d/init.el**

If you have used Emacs default you may be using the ``~/.emacs`` file for your
Emacs init file.

- Using a complete directory to hold your Emacs initialization
  file *and* other Emacs related files, like the downloaded packages, your
  spelling dictionaries, your persistent customization, etc...

- To get Emacs use the ``~/.emacs.d/init.el`` file instead:

  - Create the ``~/.emacs.d`` directory,
  - Move your ``~/.emacs`` or ``~/.emacs.el`` file to ``~/.emacs.d/init.el``.
  - When you restart Emacs, check the value of **user-emacs-directory** and
    **user-init-file**; they should reflect the new location.


Install seed7-mode for plain-vanilla Emacs
------------------------------------------

Make sure your Emacs initialization file is stored inside the ``~/.emacs.d``
directory and is ``~/.emacs.d/init.el``.  If this is not the case read the
previous section.  Once this is done proceed with the following:

- **1: Create the utils sub-directory** to store stand-alone utilities Emacs lisp files
  like seed7-mode.el.
  That directory should be located inside the directory
  identified by Emacs `user-emacs-directory`:

  - Under Unix-like OS, for example, you would normally create the `~/.emacs.d/utils` directory.

- **2: Create the init.el file if it does not exists**:

  - Emacs `user-emacs-directory` identifies the directory where the init.el
    file should be located.

    - Under Unix-like OS, the file is normally `~/.emacs.d/init.el`

  - Create the file if it does not already exist.

- **3: Update init.el: write code to find files in utils and auto-load seed7-mode**

  - Inside your init.el file, write the following code:

  .. code:: elisp

            ;;; -*-lexical-binding: t; -*-

            (push (expand-file-name "utils" user-emacs-directory) load-path)
            (autoload 'seed7-mode "seed7-mode" nil :interactive)
            (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.s\\(d7\\|7i\\)\\'" . seed7-mode))

  - The first line activates lexical-binding.
    It **must** be the very first line of the file.
  - The other lines can be anywhere, but must be executed (in case you have
    some conditional logic).

- **4: Download seed7_mode.el file and copy it in the utils directory**

  - The utils directory is the one you created above.

- **5: Byte compile seed7-mode.el**

  - Open Emacs and edit (visit) the `seed7-mode.el` file located in your utils directory.
  - Byte compile it by typing the following command: `M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load`

  Byte compiling is not absolutely necessary but it will verify that
  everything is ok inside the file and will also speed up Emacs startup.
  Just remember to byte-compile that file every time you modify it,
  otherwise Emacs will complain that it's using a byte-compile file
  that is older than the source file.


How To update seed7-mode in plain Emacs
=======================================

To update to a later revision,

- Erase the seed7-mode.el and
  seed7-mode.elc files from the utils directory where you stored them.
- Download the new revision in the same directory.
- Byte-compile the new file as described in the previous section.


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to install and use seed7-mode with PEL
==========================================

You can also use my `PEL Emacs project`_ which deals with all installation and
control details of several packages including this seed7-mode.


- First `install PEL as described in the PEL manual`_
- To activate the installation and activation of the seed7-mode package you
  must set the PEL user-option for Seed7: **pel-use-seed7** to the value ``t``
  (which is one of the possible *true* values in Emacs Lisp).

  - Once PEL is installed, use the ``C-h o pel-use-seed7 RET``  key
    sequence to open the customization buffer to set this user option.  Then close
    Emacs and restart it. PEL will download and install the file in your
    ``~/.emacs.d/utils`` directory.
  - Open a Seed7 file, PEL provides extra command key bindings for Seed7 under
    the ``F12`` key prefix.

    - See the `PEL Seed7 PDF`_ for more information about PEL Seed7 Support.
    - The `PEL Index PDF`_ has links to several other PDF files on various
      Emacs-specific topics.

How to Update Seed7-Mode with PEL
=================================

With PEL, updating is a little simpler:
just delete your ``~/.emacs.d/utils/seed7-mode.*`` files and restart Emacs;
it will download the new version and byte-compile it.


.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future
======


Once this code is stable I will add the logic to make it a proper Emacs
package and probably will include it under MELPA.  But the code is far from
being ready for that.

Any help, questions, suggestions are welcome!
